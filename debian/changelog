  * Repack upstream tarball to exclude non-free lcc compiler as
    intended: since 0.8.8 it was in code/tools/lcc, not tools/lcc, so

  * Redo portability patches based on what went upstream to ioquake3
    - d/p/Treat-GNU-kFreeBSD-and-GNU-Hurd-as-equivalent-to-GNU-Linu.patch:
      Treat all GNU platforms as essentially the same for our purposes.
      This combines what used to be d/p/Fix-FTBFS-on-kFreeBSD.patch and
      d/p/Add-support-for-the-GNU-Hurd-architecture.patch.
    - d/p/Makefile-confine-LIB-to-the-one-platform-that-needs-it-na.patch,
      d/p/build-canonicalize-all-ARM-variants-to-arm-matching-q_pla.patch,
      d/p/build-define-ARCH_STRING-in-Makefile-on-Linux-and-other-G.patch:
      Treat all CPU architectures on GNU platforms as at least potentially
      supported, without having any specific code for the majority of
      architectures. (ioquake3 PR #129, as released to Debian in
      ioquake3/1.36+u20150926+dfsg1-1)
      + In particular this means we will attempt to build on m68k
        (Closes: #865721)
    - d/p/Use-LDFLAGS-on-non-Linux-too.patch:
      Drop patch, no longer needed for any GNU platform. GNU/kFreeBSD
      and GNU/Hurd both take the GNU/Linux code paths now.
  * Re-order patch series: backports from upstream, then forwarded patches,
    and finally Debian-specific (non-upstreamable) patches
  * Move Debian-specific patches into debian/patches/debian/
  * Drop openarena-dbg, rely on automatic -dbgsym packages instead

openarena (0.8.8-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Another try at making the build reproducible: force TZ=UTC so the
    changelog date comes out the same in any timezone, and LC_ALL=C.UTF-8

openarena (0.8.8-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Disable patch numbers in debian/patches, to reduce diffstat when patches
    are re-ordered
  * Use Debian changelog date as a replacement for __DATE__, for reproducible
    builds
  * Adjust logic for installing 0.8.1-, 0.8.5- and 0.8.8-compatible modules:
    - on the client, move the real files for the 0.8.5/0.8.8-compatible
      version into a pak6-patch088 subdirectory, so it is a little clearer
      that it (deliberately) differs from the 0.8.1-compatible version in
      the pak0 subdirectory
    - on the client, the fallback version for unknown servers is now
      a symlink into pak6-patch088 to make it clearer which version is used
    - on the client, the pak6-patch085 version is a symlink into
      pak6-patch088 (they appear to be compatible)
    - on the server, stop installing the 0.8.1-compatible version: the
      server controls which dialect of the network protocol is used,
      so only the 0.8.8 game code is necessary (Closes: #781385)
    - on the server, stop installing cgame and ui modules: the server
      only needs the qagame module
  * Upload to unstable

    dh_compress in openarena-088-data and openarena-data respectively
    (Closes: #708626)
  * README.Debian: correct location of debian_server.cfg
    (part of a patch from Markus Koschany, Closes: #719592)
  * Recommend update-rc.d unconditionally: it "does the right thing"
    for each of sysvinit, systemd and upstart
  * Mention service(8) in README.Debian for completeness
  * Sync server support with quake/11:
    - remove support for START_DAEMON
    - if the server was previously disabled via START_DAEMON,
      do a one-time migration to "update-rc.d $SERVICE disable"
    - put default for DAEMON_OPTS in /etc/init.d/openarena-server so it can
      operate without /etc/default/openarena-server
    - "+exec etc/openarena-server/server.cfg" is no longer part of DAEMON_OPTS
    - add native systemd units
    - add optional instanced systemd units for multiple servers
      per machine; stop documenting how to do this with @reboot cron jobs
  * Use LDFLAGS on non-Linux too
  * Canonicalize Vcs-Git, Vcs-Browser and switch Vcs-Browser to cgit
  * Symlink all of /etc/openarena-server into the OpenArena search path
    as etc/openarena-server, so "exec etc/openarena-server/server.cfg"
    now works
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.6 (no changes needed)
  * In the .desktop file, describe it as an ActionGame, not an ArcadeGame
